# Thena plugin

Plugin is a smart-contract that connects to a liquidity pool of an Integral-powered DEX and expands itsÂ functionality.

This project is intended to simplify the process of creating a new plugin for Algebra Integral AMM. Along with the standard hardhat boilerplate, this repository includes a number of contracts that may be useful when creating a plugin.
